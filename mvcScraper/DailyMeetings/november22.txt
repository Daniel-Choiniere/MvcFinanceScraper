I have been sick for the past few days so have not been able to focus and get any work done on Phase3 until today.

Considering I am not familiar with Razor Pages, cshtml I am going to do a walk through on the Microsoft docs page.

After completing the Razor tutorial I am going to go through a tutorial on the MVC app design process.  

If I have time after the two tutorials I will start ti implement what I have learned into the MVC base scaffold that is given.

Deal with authentication.

Get my database linked.
